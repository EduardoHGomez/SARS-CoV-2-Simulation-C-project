Covid Propagation Simulation: A C project designed for the data structures course. The program employs a probability-based infection model following the specified rules:

- Red squares (E or e): People already infected
- Green squares (S or s): COVID-free people with higher chances of getting sick
- Blue squares (V or v): COVID-free people vaccinated, with less probability of getting infected
